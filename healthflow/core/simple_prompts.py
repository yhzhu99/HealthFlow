"""
Simple, LLM-driven prompt system for HealthFlow.

This module provides minimal, adaptive prompts that allow the LLM to reason
and act flexibly rather than following rigid hardcoded instructions.

CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS use Python code execution. NEVER do manual calculations.

When given ANY computational task:
1. IMMEDIATELY write Python code to solve it
2. Execute the code to get the exact answer
3. Trust the Python result over manual reasoning

You have numpy, pandas, torch, matplotlib, sklearn libraries available.
Format code in ```python``` blocks for execution.""",

ACT: Choose action (execute_code, analyze_error, fix_code, complete_task)

MANDATORY: If the task involves numbers, calculations, or math - your FIRST action must be execute_code.""",
